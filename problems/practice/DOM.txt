XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is an API in the form of an object whose methods transfer data
between a web browser and a web server. The object is provided by the browser's JavaScript environment.
Particularly, retrieval of data from XHR for the purpose of continually modifying a
loaded web page is the underlying concept of Ajax design.
